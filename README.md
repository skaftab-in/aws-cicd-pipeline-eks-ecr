# üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline for AWS EKS, ECR, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS CLI

## üìù Project Summary
This project demonstrates an **automated CI/CD pipeline** built using **Jenkins**, **AWS ECR**, **AWS EKS**, **Docker**, **AWS EC2**, **Load Balancer**, **AWS CLI**, and a **Node.js** application. The pipeline ensures **END-to-END Deployment**, where every time developers push code to the **main** branch, a new Docker image is built, tested, stored, and deployed seamlessly to AWS EKS, ensuring **high availability**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Jenkins**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application.
- **AWS ECR**: Stores Docker images securely.
- **AWS EKS**: Manages Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
- **AWS CLI**: Interacts with AWS services from the command line.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages container orchestration and application deployment.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the Jenkins server.
- **AWS Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across the pods efficiently.

## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Components and Details

### 1. **AWS EKS Cluster**

The **AWS EKS Cluster** is the backbone of this project. It provides a managed Kubernetes environment where the application is deployed. The cluster ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

### 2. **Node Group**

The **Node Group** consists of EC2 instances managed by AWS EKS. These nodes run the Kubernetes pods that host the application. The group ensures efficient resource allocation and scaling.

### 3. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**

The **Elastic Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across the Kubernetes pods, ensuring high availability and balancing the load efficiently.

### 4. **AWS ECR**

The **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** securely stores the Docker images built during the pipeline. These images are used for deployment to the EKS cluster.

### 5. **GitHub Webhook**

A **GitHub Webhook** is configured to trigger the Jenkins pipeline automatically whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

### 6. **Jenkins Pipeline**

The **Jenkins Pipeline** automates the entire CI/CD process, from building and testing the application to deploying it on AWS EKS. The pipeline is configured to handle rolling updates and rollbacks seamlessly.

### 7. **Changes Reflected After Pipeline Execution**
The **CICD pipeline** is triggered automatically via a GitHub webhook, executing all defined stages sequentially, from code checkout to deployment on AWS EKS.

![AWS Instance Connect Terminal Commands](img/aws-instance-connect-terminal_K8s.png)

**Description:**
- `kubectl get pods`: Displays all running pods.
- `kubectl get svc`: Lists all services and their endpoints.
- `kubectl get all`: Provides a complete overview of Kubernetes resources.

- **First Output:** The initial version of the application is deployed after pushing code to the GitHub repository. The first version of the basic page is displayed.


#### **Frontend Updates**
- **Change 1:**  Changes to `index.html` trigger the pipeline, and the updated content is reflected on the frontend.

- **Change 2:** Additional modifications are made to the application, and these changes are seamlessly deployed and reflected on the live website post pipeline execution.

### 8. **Kubernetes Rolling Updates**


Kubernetes ensures zero downtime by performing rolling updates. If a deployment fails, Kubernetes can roll back to a previous stable version.

## üîÑ Features of the Pipeline

- **Zero Downtime Deployment**: The application is updated seamlessly without any downtime, thanks to Kubernetes **rolling updates**.
- **Rollback**: In case of an issue, the application can be **rolled back** to a previous stable version using Kubernetes.
- **Fully Automated**: The entire process from code push to deployment is automated, reducing manual intervention.

## Jenkins Pipeline Configuration üìã

### Key Features:

- Automatically builds and pushes Docker images with a unique tag (`BUILD_NUMBER`).
- Deploys to AWS EKS using Kubernetes manifests.
- Ensures zero-downtime updates with Kubernetes rollouts.

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes YAML File

The Kubernetes deployment and service manifest file (`app.yaml`) is used for deploying the application and exposing it via a LoadBalancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-app-aws-cicd-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-app-devops-project
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-app-devops-project
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-app-devops-project
        image: public.ecr.aws/x9f9n9e7/k8s_end_to_end_deployment:node_app_DevOps_Proj_v0.15
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: node-app-aws-cicd-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: node-app-devops-project
