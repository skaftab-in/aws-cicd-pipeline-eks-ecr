# üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline for AWS EKS, ECR, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS CLI

## üìù Project Summary

This project demonstrates an **automated CI/CD pipeline** built using **Jenkins**, **AWS ECR**, **AWS EKS**, **Docker**, **AWS EC2**, **Load Balancer**, and **AWS CLI**. This pipeline ensures that every time developers push code to the main branch, a new Docker image is built, tested, stored, and deployed seamlessly to AWS EKS with **zero downtime** and **high availability**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Jenkins**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application.
- **AWS ECR**: Stores Docker images securely.
- **AWS EKS**: Manages Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
- **AWS CLI**: Interacts with AWS services from the command line.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages container orchestration and application deployment.
- **AWS EC2**: As a jenkins server.
- **AWS Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic accros the pods efficiently.

## üèóÔ∏è How the Pipeline Works
![Jenkins Pipeline View](stage_output.png) 

1. **Checkout Stage**: The Jenkins polls the repository for changes and checks out the latest code from the main branch. **main branch**.
2. **Code Testing**: Installs dependencies and runs tests using **Mocha** to ensure everything works smoothly.
3. **Docker Build**: Builds a **Docker image** from the application code and tags it with the Jenkins build number.
4. **Push to AWS ECR**: The Docker image is pushed to **AWS ECR**, where it‚Äôs securely stored.
5. **Deploy to AWS EKS**: The Docker image is deployed to **AWS EKS**. If the deployment exists, it updates the image; if not, it creates a new one.
6. **Rolling Update in Kubernetes**: Kubernetes performs a **rolling update**, ensuring that the application remains available without downtime.
8. **Rollback**: If any issue arises, Kubernetes allows you to easily **rollback** to a previous version of the application.

## üîÑ Features of the Pipeline

- **Zero Downtime Deployment**: The application is updated seamlessly without any downtime, thanks to Kubernetes **rolling updates**.
- **Rollback**: In case of an issue, the application can be **rolled back** to a previous stable version using Kubernetes.
- **Fully Automated**: The entire process from code push to deployment is automated, reducing manual intervention.

## Jenkins Pipeline Configuration üìã

### Key Features:

- Automatically builds and pushes Docker images with a unique tag (`BUILD_NUMBER`).
- Deploys to AWS EKS using Kubernetes manifests.
- Ensures zero-downtime updates with Kubernetes rollouts.

### Jenkinsfile
